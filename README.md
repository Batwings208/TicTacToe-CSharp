# TicTacToe-CSharp
I made a very simple TicTacToe game in console which works very nicely and is fun to play. Please feel for to use my code for anything just give me credit. I made this game in CSharp and tried to make it as simple as i could for people to understand but you should learn the language first if you haven't already.


**Advise: **
Use parts of my code and write the rest yourself so you learn something too :)

Good Luck! Please Enjoy! ðŸ˜Š
