# TicTacToe-CSharp
I made a very simple TicTacToe game in console which works very nicely and is fun to play. Please feel for to use my code for anything just give me credit. I made this game in CSharp and tried to make it as simple as i could for people to understand but you should learn the language first if you haven't already. This is my first project in CSharp but I should have done a lot better. I will work on updating it in the future.
