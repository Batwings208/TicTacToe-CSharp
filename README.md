# TicTacToe-CSharp

**Overview**
This is a C# program. It is a console-based imitation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe Game. This game is played on a 3x3 grid. Two Players, 'X' and 'O', take turns and rotate marking spaces of their choice on the grid. The whole aim of the game is to have three markings in either a row, column or diagonally to win. The first person who reaches this goal, takes the win. The program will continuely give the players options to mark until a player wins.
